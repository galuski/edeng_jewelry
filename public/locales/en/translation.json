  "About-Text": "Hello,\nMy name is Eden Gedj.\nI've always loved crafting, creating art, and designing.\nFor me, jewelry holds a special place in my heart; it’s truly one of my greatest passions.\nJewelry has the power to highlight the unique light of the person wearing it.\nIt is much more than just an accessory or body decoration; it carries a story, energy, memories, and even family heritage.\n\nThat’s why jewelry excites me.\nWhen I’m in my workshop, creating a new piece, I feel like I’m in another universe—where time doesn’t exist, and I’m fully immersed in a state of creative flow.\nIt’s a feeling that’s hard to put into words.\n\nMy inspiration comes mainly from nature itself.\nEach piece is one of a kind, handmade with care, crafted from sterling silver or 14K gold.\nIn addition, I create custom-made jewelry tailored to individual wishes.\n\nEnjoy the magic!",
