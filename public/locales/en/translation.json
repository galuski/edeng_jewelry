  "About-Text": "I have always loved to make craft works, create art & designs. For me, jewelry holds a special place in my heart, and it is truly one of my weaknesses.\n\nJewelry can highlight the unique glam of the person wearing it. It is much more than an object or body decoration; it carries a story, energy, memory, and even family heritage.\n\nThat’s why jewelry excites me. When I’m at my workshop, creating, I feel like I’m in another universe, where time doesn't exist, and I’m in a state of flow energy. It’s very special and hard to describe in words.\n\nMy inspiration mainly comes from nature itself, especially from the ocean. The jewelry displayed on the website is all one-of-a-kind, handmade from silver or 14k gold.\n\nIn addition, I create custom-made jewelry, which is also something that always excites me, because during this process I must connect on a very deep level to my client’s head & heart so that I can create something that was made only for them or for their loved ones.",
